            <h3><b>Teacher Experience and Teacher Effectiveness</b></h3><br>
            <h4><b>Author :</b> Tara Kini, Anne Podolsky</h4>
            <h4><b>Link :</b> https://www.aft.org/ae/fall2016/notebook</h4><br>
            <p>Experienced teacher has positive impacted to the students progress and enhance student success not just academical performances but also in broader measures of success. This studies explore the nuances of teaching experience impacts students outcomes, the role of supportive work environment, and the implication for educational policy. </p><br>
            <p>One of the key findings across these studies is the strong positive association between teaching experience and student achievement gains. The data indicates that experienced teachers contribute to student learning in multiple ways. Their familiarity with curriculum, classroom management, and instructional strategies allows them to adapt their teaching to meet diverse student needs effectively. I believe that their experiences shape them to become more effective as they expose and learn from their diverse students it will easily for them to use appropriate strategies and approach in teaching. The ability of experienced teachers to foster  student outcomes beyond academics suggests that they play a crucial role in developing the overall school climate. Their accumulated skills and knowledge contribute to creating classrooms where students feel supported and motivated to succeed, which is essential for fostering long-term educational engagement.</p><br>
            <p>The studies also highlight the importance of the work environment in enhancing teacher effectiveness. Teachers who work in supportive, collegial environments, and who have stability in their teaching assignments, tend to show greater improvements in effectiveness. As pre-service teacher who worked with professional one, an welcoming and supportive work environment enhance my confidence and effectiveness as a student teacher during my internship. A positive work environment allows teachers to collaborate, share best practices, and receive feedback, all of which contribute to professional growth.</p><br>
            <p>Also, the findings from these studies have profound implications for educational policy. First, policies should aim to attract and retain high-quality teachers by recognizing the long-term benefits of teaching experience. Initiatives such as competitive salaries, opportunities for professional development, and supportive working conditions are essential to retain experienced educators. Second, policies should promote stability in teacher assignments and foster positive school cultures. Creating conditions that support teachers in building their expertise in specific areas can lead to greater improvements in students learning outcomes. Lastly, Ensuring the high-need schools have access to experienced educators can help address disparities in educational outcomes and provide all students opportunity to high quality education.</p><br>
            <br>  <h3><b>The process of becoming a teacher: Student Teachers Discover Classroom Realities</b></h3><br>
            <h4><b>Author :</b> Nancy Joseph</h4>
            <h4><b>Link :</b>//doi.org/10.9707/2168-149X.1246</h4><br>
            <p>Teaching internships provide a crucial element in the preparation of future educators. My internship experience offered diverse opportunities and allowed me to apply different teaching approaches and methods I learned at university. For instance, I applied collaborative learning techniques in group activities, which significantly improved student engagement. This hands-on application served as a practical bridge between theory and practice, deepening my understanding of effective teaching strategies.</p><br>
            <p>Pre-service teachers are often confined to established routines and structures. While these environments provide valuable insights into classroom management, curriculum delivery, and student engagement, they can limit the scope of experiential learning. I believe community-based field experiences are essential as they offer opportunities to engage with teaching and learning in diverse contexts. For example, I participated in a community outreach program that integrated local history into the curriculum, enhancing my ability to connect classroom content with real-world experiences. These experiences broaden our understanding of various pedagogical approaches and allow us to practice different aspects of teaching in more dynamic and informal settings.</p><br>
            <p>Community-based placements enable pre-service teachers to leverage local resources to support and enhance learning. Engaging with local cultural institutions, community projects, or informal learning opportunities helps teachers view education as a holistic process extending beyond the classroom walls. This perspective is critical in fostering a well-rounded educational approach that resonates with diverse student backgrounds and experiences.</p><br>
            <p>However, these experiences are not without challenges. Managing diverse student groups in less controlled environments and applying pedagogical theories without the clear framework of a traditional classroom can be difficult. For example, adapting lesson plans on the fly during outdoor activities tested my ability to maintain student focus and achieve learning objectives. Despite these challenges, they are invaluable learning opportunities. They encourage pre-service teachers to develop flexibility, resilience, and a broader pedagogical toolkit.</p><br>
            <h3><b>The Challenges of teaching in 21st Century</b></h3><br>
            <h4><b>Link :</b> https://www.aulm.edu.eu/the-challenges-of-teaching-in-the-21st-century/</h4><br>
            <p>Teaching in the 21st century indeed presents a unique set of challenges and opportunities. The integration of technology, the emphasis on inclusivity, and the need to adapt to rapidly changing learning environments require a shift in traditional educational approaches. From a technological standpoint, the use of digital tools and resources has revolutionized education. For instance, during my internship, I used interactive software to facilitate remote learning and enhance student engagement. This experience underscored the importance of technology in making education more accessible and interactive. However, it also highlighted the need for teachers to continuously update their technical skills and adapt to new tools to stay relevant and effective.</p><br>
            <p>Another critical aspect of modern teaching is Promoting inclusivity in the classroom. I encountered diverse student backgrounds and learning needs during my internship. Addressing these effectively required me to differentiate my teaching methods and create an inclusive environment that respected and valued each student's unique perspective. This experience taught me the importance of empathy, cultural competence, and tailored instructional strategies in fostering an inclusive classroom.</p><br>
            <p>Continuous professional development and collaboration with colleagues have been instrumental in addressing these challenges. Participating in workshops, peer observations, and collaborative planning sessions during my internship enriched my teaching practice and provided fresh perspectives. These experiences reinforced the value of lifelong learning and the power of collective wisdom in navigating the complexities of modern education.</p><br>
            <p>Adapting to evolving learning needs is essential in today’s educational context. The rapid changes in society and the job market demand that students develop critical thinking, problem-solving, and adaptability skills.</p><br>

            <h1 id="JOURNAL">JOURNAL</h1>
            <div class="line"></div><br>
            <h5>WEEK 1</h5><br>
            <p>My first week as a student teacher at our new cooperating school has been a week of learning and adjustment. Starting this role, I felt both excited and nervous about what lay ahead. The week began with getting to know the school’s routines and meeting my cooperating teacher. Watching her manage the classroom gave me a good idea of how to handle students and plan lessons effectively. These observations were very helpful as I prepared for my own teaching duties.</p><br>
            <p>By the third day, I had to create my first lesson plan and prepare the materials for my class the next day. This was a challenging task that required careful planning and creativity. I needed to make sure my lesson was both educational and engaging for the students. This preparation taught me the importance of balancing solid content with interesting and interactive elements to keep students interested.</p><br>
            <p>As the week came to an end, I was both excited and nervous about teaching on my own. Delivering my first lesson was a real test of how well I had prepared. While the start of my lesson went smoothly, I quickly faced some challenges, especially with keeping the students engaged. Some of them were less interested than I expected, and I had to change my approach on the spot. This experience taught me that being flexible and ready to adapt is crucial in teaching. Despite these difficulties, my first week of teaching was a valuable learning experience. It showed me the importance of preparing well but also being able to adjust to the students’ needs in the classroom. This week has provided me with essential lessons and skills that will help me grow as a teacher.</p><br>
           
            <h5>WEEK 2</h5><br>
            <p>My second week as a student teacher in our new cooperating school has been a blend of excitement and learning. Without the chance to observe a mentor, I had to quickly adapt to the new schedule and the teaching environment. Each day involved careful preparation of lesson plans to ensure that my classes were well-organized. While a few students actively participated, my goal is to engage everyone in the discussions. Even though my students are generally well-behaved, I still find it challenging to explain topics clearly to all of them. This week, I realized how important it is to adjust assessments to match students’ abilities while still promoting higher-order thinking skills. Balancing effective teaching with meeting each student’s needs is a lesson I will carry forward.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 3</h5><br>
            <p>This week, my focus was on preparing my students for their third periodical exam. To make the review sessions engaging, I integrated games into my lessons, which greatly improved student participation. Almost all the students took part enthusiastically, making the learning process lively and interactive. However, this also tested my classroom management skills. While the students were attentive, there were moments when the excitement led to a noisy environment, which required careful balancing to maintain order without stifling their enthusiasm.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 4</h5><br>
            <p>This week, I supervised my students during their third periodical exam. Watching them take the test gave me a chance to learn more about each student. I saw different ways they approached their work and understood more about their strengths and areas where they might need help.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 5</h5><br>
            <p>This week, we switched to asynchronous classes in Quezon City due to the hot weather. Adapting to remote learning meant I had to create creative ways to communicate with students. One challenge was making sure students were doing their tasks on their own, as it was hard to know for sure if they were actively participating. This change taught me the importance of giving clear instructions and finding ways to keep students engaged and accountable, even when we’re not in the same room.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 6</h5><br>
            <p>This week, we switched to asynchronous classes in Quezon City due to the hot weather. Adapting to remote learning meant I had to create creative ways to communicate with students. One challenge was making sure students were doing their tasks on their own, as it was hard to know for sure if they were actively participating. This change taught me the importance of giving clear instructions and finding ways to keep students engaged and accountable, even when we’re not in the same room.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 7</h5><br>
            <p>This week was challenging because all classes were asynchronous, making it hard to follow the lesson plan with so many activities. It was difficult to track students’ progress and motivate them to submit their work on time. Even during face-to-face classes, I struggled to encourage students to complete their assignments due to the overwhelming workload given by other subject teachers. Another issue was that some students didn’t know what to do, even with additional learning materials like modules and YouTube links, and some didn’t have cellphones or access to the internet. These challenges made teaching and learning more complicated. </p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 8</h5><br>
            <p>This week, there was a new DepEd memo declaring asynchronous classes when the heat index reaches 40°C. Despite this, I still sent out activities with YouTube links and took attendance as usual throughout the week. It was heartening to see that despite the circumstances, some students showed eagerness to learn. A few even reached out to me through messenger to ask questions, showing their dedication to their studies.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 9</h5><br>
            <p>This week has been tough due to continued asynchronous classes, which makes it hard to connect with my students regularly. I wanted to conduct online classes to engage with them directly, but my cooperating teacher suggested that this might not work well since only a few students would likely attend. Instead, I was advised to continue giving tasks, which felt less interactive but necessary under the circumstances.
                Preparing for my upcoming demo teaching next week has been stressful. There’s uncertainty about whether it will be face-to-face or online, which adds to the pressure. Because of this, I’ve had to prepare for both scenarios, ensuring I have plans ready for either face-to-face or online learning. </p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 10</h5><br>
            <p>This week, I tried a dry run for my demo teaching online because we still didn’t know the learning mode. Unfortunately, only six students attended. Then, DepEd released a new memo requiring schools to conduct limited face-to-face classes on the day of my demo teaching. This made it the most tiring week yet, with a sudden switch back to in-person classes. Despite the exhaustion, I felt happy and relieved once the demo teaching was done, especially after managing both the uncertainty and the return to face-to-face teaching.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 11</h5><br>
            <p>This week, I worked on completing the students’ records to prepare their grades. It was difficult because many students didn’t submit all their tasks. I also saw firsthand how many forms and paperwork teachers have to handle. This experience gave me a better understanding of the administrative side of teaching and the challenges teachers face in keeping everything organized.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 12</h5><br>
            <p>This week was the time for the students’ fourth periodical exam, and it felt bittersweet since it’s likely the last time I’ll see the whole class together. To help them prepare, I held review sessions for Thursday and Friday, incorporating a game which is called “Alert Games” to make it fun. It was a joyful way to wrap up the week, and I’m glad the students engaged and enjoyed the activities.</p><br>
            <h5>WEEK 13</h5><br>
            <p>This was my final week at the cooperating school. Before we left, we were given some tasks to complete which we accomplished through teamwork. I also helped my cooperating teacher give out report cards and awards in the classroom. It was nice to see the students get their cards and be recognized. I felt happy and relieved to finish my teaching internship, looking back on everything I’ve learned.</p><br>
